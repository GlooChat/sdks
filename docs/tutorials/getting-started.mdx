### Installation

First, ensure you have created an application and a secret key in the [Gloo Dashboard](app.trygloo.com/dashboard).
  
Next, install the gloo client as shown below.
<CodeGroup>

```bash javascript
npm install -g gloo-client
```

```bash python
pip install gloo-client
```
</CodeGroup>

Import the gloo client in your code and initialize it with your secret key.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Typescript

import { createGlooClient, ICreateDocumentRequest } from "gloo-client";

const appId = "123456-123456-123456";
const secretKey = "gloo:your-secret";

// this client lets you create or delete apps.
const gloo = createGlooClient(testSecret);

// If you want to upload docs to an app or search, create the app client
const app = gloo.appClient({ appId: appId });


```

```python Python

client = GlooClient(secret_key=secretKey)
# Select the app you want
gloo = client.app(app_id=appId)

gloo.search(query="hello there!")


```
</CodeGroup>

### Upload and Search
Finally you can upload a document and search your app index.
Note you can tag documents and filter by those tags when searching.

The `source` is a unique identifier used to index the document.
If you upload a document with the same source string, it will fail unless you specifically request call `documentUpdate`.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Typescript

// Upload a document
const createDoc: ICreateDocumentRequest = {
  name: "test doc",
  source: "https://website-or-filename",
  tags: ["test", "tag"],
  content: {
    type: "text",
    value: "hello darkness my old friend",
  }
}
const response = await app.documentCreate(createDoc);

// Search for documents
const result = await app.search({
  query: "What do simon and garfunkel sing?",
})
```

</CodeGroup>

You can tune the search by modifying the `alpha` parameter in the search query. A higher `alpha` will give more weight to semantic searching, while a lower one will give more weight to keyword-type search.
